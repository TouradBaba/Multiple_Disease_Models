# Multiple Disease Models

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting various health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it includes a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with these models through a user-friendly interface.

## Models Included:

1. **Diabetes Disease Model**:
   - This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

2. **Heart Disease Model**:
   - This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, etc.

3. **Parkinson's Disease Model**:
   - This model predicts whether a person has Parkinson's disease using various features.


## Usage:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TouradBaba/Health_Prediction_Models.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Multiple_Disease_Models
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit web application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Access the web application in your browser.
